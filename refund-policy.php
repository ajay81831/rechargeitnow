					<p>
						Normally a refund will be issued to you instantaneously. However in some cases the refund may take 2 working days and you will receive a refund confirmation mail within that period. Please note in refund cases, the concerned bank may take 4-7 working days to post a credit to your account.
					</p>

					<p>
						This is an automatic process and will be followed in all cases, however, for cases where you have received a success confirmation but not received a recharge or credit for your bill payment or any other case you are welcome to log a complaint by opening a support ticket on our contact us page and we will provide you a quick resolution.
					</p>

					<p>
						In cases, where you are not satisfied with the resolution, you may submit an escalation ticket on our contact us page by choosing 'escalation' option. Escalation requests will be accepted only after 8 days of the transaction.
					</p>

					<p>
						Kindly note, in all cases our liability is only restricted to providing you a valid recharge, payment of your bill or refund to the extent of payment received by us. We shall not be responsible for any other claim or consequential liability arising out of a failed recharge or bill payment on our system.
